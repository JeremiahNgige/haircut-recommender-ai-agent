# Haircut Recommender AI Agent

## Overview
The Haircut Recommender AI Agent is an innovative application designed to provide personalized haircut suggestions based on user preferences, facial features, and hair types. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, this system aims to enhance the haircut selection process, making it more enjoyable and satisfying for users.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides tailored suggestions that match the user’s style and preferences.

- **Visual Analysis**: Analyzes user-uploaded images to determine the most flattering haircuts for their face shape and features.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Users provide information about their hair type, style preferences, and any specific requirements.
2. **Image Analysis**: If a user uploads a photo, the system analyzes facial features to ensure optimal haircut recommendations.
